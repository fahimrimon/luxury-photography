                    <h5>Five major reasons we use Firebase.</h5>
                    <p>1. Analytics: <br />Firebase Analytics is a product that I think every scale, type, kind of developer must use. <br />2. Remote config: <br />Firebase Remote Config lets you do the A/B testing, provide a personalized experience and much more, totally depends on how you use it. <br />3. Database: <br />Firebase Database is something we can call super amazing! It provides two types of database to you. <br />4. Cloud Messaging: <br />Firebase Cloud Messaging is also a convenient and useful product; its basic functionality is implemented as soon as you put its dependency on Android Studio. <br />5. Authentication: <br />Firebase Authentication can help you to implement the feature that a newbie can dream of, like doing email/SMS verification, letting users sign in/sign up.</p>
